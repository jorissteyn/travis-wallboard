Features still being added but at this moment it is possible to see builds for all your travis projects in once (will show all non pull request branches)
Or will show the last x builds for a single project.

At first use the company id will be asked and a token.

if you do not fill them in you can set them trough the settings.

Settings will allow you to generate a travis token from a github token.
